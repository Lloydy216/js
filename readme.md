## üöÄ Quick Start

### **1. Clone and Setup**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breakout-game.git
cd breakout-game
```

### **2. Supabase Setup (Optional for leaderboard)**
1. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a `leaderboard` table with these columns:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE leaderboard (
     id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     username TEXT NOT NULL,
     score BIGINT NOT NULL,
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```
3. Enable Row Level Security and create policies for anonymous access
4. Update `supabase-config.js` with your project credentials

### **3. Run the Game**
- **Option 1**: Open `game.html` directly in a web browser
- **Option 2**: Serve with a local server: `python -m http.server 8000`
- **Option 3**: Use any static file server of your choice

## üéÆ How to Play

### **Basic Controls**
1. **Start the game** from the main menu
2. **Control the paddle** with mouse/touch or arrow keys
3. **Break all bricks** to complete the level
4. **Avoid losing the ball** - you have 3 lives
5. **Collect power-ups** for special abilities
6. **Save your score** to compete on the global leaderboard

### **Power-up System**
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Extra Life**: Adds one life to your total
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Paddle Extend**: Makes paddle 50% larger for easier ball control
- ‚¨áÔ∏è **Paddle Shrink**: Makes paddle 30% smaller for increased challenge
- ‚öΩ **Multi-ball**: Creates 2 additional balls for faster brick clearing
- ‚ö° **Speed Boost**: Increases ball speed by 50% for dynamic gameplay

### **Scoring System**
- **1 point** per brick destroyed
- **Power-ups** appear randomly when breaking bricks
- **High scores** are saved to the global leaderboard
- **Medals** are awarded for top 3 positions
