Retro Arcade Breakout
Retro Arcade Breakout is a classic-style browser game inspired by the original Breakout. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this is my second project on the course, aimed at strengthening my understanding of DOM manipulation, JavaScript logic, and interactive gameplay. The objective is simple: use a paddle to keep the ball in play, break all the bricks, and avoid losing all your lives.

Responsive paddle control using mouse movement (left to right)

🧱 Multiple layers of bricks to break through

🧮 Real-time scoreboard tracking your points

❤️ Limited lives system for added challenge

💥 Win and Game Over screens

🕹️ Retro arcade design with bold visuals

🎯 User Stories
👤 User 1 – Scorekeeper
As a player, I want to have multiple lives and a scoreboard so that I can track my progress and stay engaged.

👤 User 2 – Casual Gamer
As a player, I want the game to get faster over time so that the difficulty increases the longer I play.

👤 User 3 – Visual Enthusiast
As a player, I want fun visual effects like flashing or animated bricks when I hit them, to make the gameplay more exciting.

🛠 Technologies Used
HTML – Game structure and layout

CSS – Styling and retro visual effects

JavaScript  Core game logic, collision detection, and interactivity

🎮 How to Play
